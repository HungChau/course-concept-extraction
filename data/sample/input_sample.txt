000001	This course emphasizes the study of the basic data structures of computer science (stacks, queues, trees, lists) and their implementations using the java language included in this study are programming techniques which use recursion, reference variables, and dynamic memory allocation.  Students in this course are also introduced to various searching and sorting methods and also expected to develop an intuitive understanding of the complexity of these algorithms.
000002	This course aims to expose students to different data management, data manipulation, and data analysis techniques. The class will cover all the major data management paradigms (relational/SQL, XML/Xquery, RDF/SPARQL) including NOSQL and data stream processing approaches. Going beyond traditional data management techniques, the class will expose students to information retrieval, data mining, data warehousing, network analysis, and other data analysis topics. Time permitting, the class will include big data processing techniques, such as the map/reduce framework.
